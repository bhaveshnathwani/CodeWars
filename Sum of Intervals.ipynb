    "**Description:**\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Write a function called sumIntervals/sum_intervals() that accepts an array of intervals, and returns the sum of all the interval lengths. Overlapping intervals should only be counted once.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "**Intervals**\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Intervals are represented by a pair of integers in the form of an array. The first value of the interval will always be less than the second value. Interval example: [1, 5] is an interval from 1 to 5. The length of this interval is 4.\n",

    "   [7, 10],\n",
    "   [3, 5]\n",
    "]\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "The sum of the lengths of these intervals is 7. Since [1, 4] and [3, 5] overlap, we can treat the interval as [1, 5], which has a length of 4.\n",
